Welcome to my online banking database application!

Some notes:

-TableCommander class contains all the necessary SQL commands used on the database
-UI is the basic UI for the application
-FXML files are associated with/used for the GUI
-If you attempt to copy and paste the code into your own compiler for testing, you'll need to have multiple things setup, such as MySQL connection, 
correct .jar files in the library folder, etc. (search up "How to connect MySQL database to Java IDE" for tutorials)
